**Project Description**
🚀 DigitVision is a deep learning project focused on classifying handwritten digits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project leverages the popular MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of digits (0-9). The model achieves high accuracy by applying layers of convolution, pooling, and dense layers to extract meaningful patterns from the images.

**Key Features:**
🔧 CNN Architecture: A three-layer convolutional network designed for high accuracy and efficiency.
📊 Data Preprocessing: Images are normalized and reshaped to fit the input shape required by the CNN.
⚡ Model Training: Trained on the MNIST dataset for 5 epochs using Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
📈 Performance Metrics: Includes evaluation on test data with validation accuracy tracking.
📤 User Interaction: Upload your own handwritten digit images for the model to predict.

**Tools & Technologies:**
💻 TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the CNN.
📚 MNIST Dataset: Handwritten digit dataset used for training and testing.
📊 Matplotlib: To visualize training performance.

This project provides a practical example of using deep learning for computer vision tasks, perfect for those interested in machine learning, image recognition, or model deployment! 🔍
